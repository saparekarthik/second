## Case Study Intro

The Case Study has been split in three parts. In the `Analysis` section please use valid [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) to give your answers. The robots will be pleased. Please bear in mind that there is no perfect/single solution, the point of the Case Study is to determine analytical skills of a candidate ðŸ¤“

### 1) Dockerfile

We have a simple `Dockerfile`, can't be simpler than this to be honest. But as we all know even the simple things can be optimized further. There are four main issues with this `Dockerfile`, please try to identify them and improve the configuration. Afterwards you're more than welcome to ask the Magic 8-ball a question.

### 2) WordPress with `docker-compose`

We have a basic WordPress installation with MySQL. Since this is the basic setup please add Nginx reverse proxy and serve on HTTPS. Dummy TLS key and certificate will suffice. Also, please move sensitive data out of `docker-compose.yml` and store them in a more secure way.

### 3) GitHub Actions

Please take a look at `.github` folder and try to analyze the files there. What is the purpose of these files? Try to be as detailed as possible, try to identify the outcome, suggest possible improvements, etc.
